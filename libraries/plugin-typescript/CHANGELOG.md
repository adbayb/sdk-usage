    - `@sdk-usage/core`: `createSyntaxPlugin` has been renamed to `createPlugin`.
    - `@sdk-usage/core`: `plugins` accepts now directly an array of plugins.
    - `@sdk-usage/plugin-jsx`: `@sdk-usage/plugin-syntax-jsx` is deprecated (will be removed soon from the registry) and renamed to `@sdk-usage/plugin-jsx`.
    - `@sdk-usage/plugin-typescript`: `@sdk-usage/plugin-syntax-typescript` is deprecated (will be removed soon from the registry) and renamed to `@sdk-usage/plugin-typescript`.
